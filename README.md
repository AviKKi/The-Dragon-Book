# Compilers Principles, Techniques, &amp; Tools'(aka The Dragon Book) Code in Python :snake:

### Something I hope you know before go into the repo

* First, please **watch** :eyes: or **star** :star2: this repo as it's still under constant updation.
* Project aims to provide good reference code for all the examples and exercises in the book.
* Bug report, questions and discussion are welcome, you can post an [issue](https://github.com/AviKKi/The-Dragon-Book/issues/new) or [pull a request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
* As the original book's code is in Java I have tried my best to write it in idiomatic python, if you found any bug, please [tell me](https://github.com/AviKKi/The-Dragon-Book/issues/new), thanks.
